// Requirements:
// 1. Each replica must be on a different broker (unless replicationFactor < brokerCount makes it impossible).
// 2. Partitions should be balanced as evenly as possible across the brokers

// Optimization:
// If, while we're looking for a broker to assigning a replica to, we find there are multiple "good" brokers, we can
// optimize according to the following priority list.
//   1. rack: try to stay within the same rack, maybe even the same broker (is that neccesary?)
//   2. partition count, brokers should have roughly the same number of replicas (need to get all topics, all their partitions to even know which broker has which partitions)
//   3. disk space, only if partition count is equal and can't help us decide

// also optimize network traffic: that means trying to stay "inter rack" (bc that traffic is mostly free)
//
// maybe "unassign" all replicas, subtracing used disk space from that broker,
// then, from a fresh start, assign preferably to the original broker, or to a broker in the same rack, or ... (using optimization priorities)
